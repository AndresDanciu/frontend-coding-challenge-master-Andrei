# Summary

Author: Andrei Danciu

Time: 1 hour and 30 minutes (Monday morning without coffee =( )

- [x]  All points completed

Project feature:

- Implementation of Clean Architecture (Features, adapters....).
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management with **RKT-Query** for call caching and **Optimistic updated**.
- **Eslint** and **prettier**.

Problems I've encountered:

- I am not an expert in **style components** (I use **CSS | SASS modules**).

    For performance issues I recommend to use [https://compiledcssinjs.com/](https://compiledcssinjs.com/) or [https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/getting-started/](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/getting-started/)

- I thought about using Chakra UI for prototyping, but in the end I decided to do it manually to be faster.
- Time.

Things I would have liked to add:

- [ ]  Unit and integration tests with Jest
- [ ]  E2E test with playwright.
- [ ]  Using Vite instead of CRA
- [ ]  Stylint
- [ ]  Generator of components, features... from static files with cli (plopfile)
- [ ]  Semantic HTML and accessibility
- [ ]  i18n
- [ ]  â€¦..
